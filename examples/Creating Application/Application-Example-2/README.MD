# Application Example
This is an example for building an OSGi Application using the `com.github.niikhilghodke.applicationBuilder`.
When you build the application and run the application then its by default starts a bundle with name `ActivatorBundle` and 
prints "Hello Everyone - Bundle is started!!!" within the framework.

## How to build the project

Inorder to build this example project follow these steps
1) Open this example project on your computer.
2) Open command prompt and type `./gradlew buildApplication`
These two simple steps will build your OSGi Application. You can find the built OSGi bundle in `build/apps` directory.

## How to run the built Project
1) Open the the `build/app` within this project.
2) Open Command Prompt within the `build/app` directory.
3) Now type `java -jar org.eclipse.osgi-3.13.200.jar -console`
And within three steps you have an Osgi Application running.

## Explaining the example project in detail

The Plugin creates three tasks by Default Tasks named `copyBundles`,`setConfiguration` and `buildApplication`. `buildApplication` task `dependsOn` `copyBundles` and `setConfiguration` and does nothing different, so that user has to just run one task to build the application.

1) `copyBundle` task is a task of type `CopyBundle` which helps in copying copying dependencies of a particular type into a particular directory. By default it copies all the dependencies of of configuration `osgiInstall` into `build/app` directory. The user is always free to select any another directory and configuration to build the application 

2) Another small point worth noticing is that in order to build an osgi application, you need to perform following steps<br>
  a) Copy bundles into one directory<br>
  b) Write configuration file  `configuration/config.ini` as per the requirements ( like which bundles needs to be included in application and which bundles should be started when the application starts).<br>
The first task of copying bundles is accomplished by `copyBundle` task and the second task is completed by `setConfiguration` task. The Plugin as previously explained creates three tasks<br>
a)`copyBundles`<br>
b)`setConfiguration`<br>
c)`build`<br>
The`build` tasks just depends on `copyBundle` task and `setConfiguration` task, so that does not have to run two tasks to build the application instead he could just run one command `gradle build` and his application is ready. This also means that you can build your application by running two commands `gradle copyBundles` and then run `gradle setConfiguration` and still get the same application.

3) `copyBundles` is of Custom task type `CopyBundles`and `setConfiguration` is of Custom task type `WriteEquinoxConfgiration`.
So users are free to create as many tasks of these Custom task types for building the application.
